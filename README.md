# Toucan Tweaks

This repository contains a very small CSS theme for Zen Browser. It is expected to be used on top of other themes, such as [Natsumi Browser by Greeen-Dev](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/natsumi-browser) and [Pineapple Fried by TheBigWazz](https://github.com/TheBigWazz/Pineapple-Fried). As such, all ToucanTweaks does by itself is change some icons. The menu button is changed to the Zen logo, and the unified extensions button is changed to a version with a subtle Z shape in it. In addition, the logos of [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search), [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search), [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors), [Cast Kodi](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/castkodi/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search), [KeepassXC-Browser](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search), [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search), and [ProtonPass](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/proton-pass/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) are changed to appear like they are a native part of the browser. Further extensions will be added on request.
